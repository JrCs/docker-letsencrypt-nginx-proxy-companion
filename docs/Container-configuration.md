## Optional container environment variables for custom configuration.

* `ACME_CA_URI` - Directory URI for the CA ACME API endpoint (defaults to ``https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory``).

If you set this environment variable value to `https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory` the container will obtain its certificates from Let's Encrypt test API endpoint that don't have the [5 certs/week/domain limit](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/) (but are not trusted by browsers).

For example

```bash
$ docker run --detach \
    --name nginx-proxy-letsencrypt \
    --volumes-from nginx-proxy \
    --volume /path/to/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:rw \
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
    --env "ACME_CA_URI=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory" \
    jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion
```
You can also create test certificates per container (see [Test certificates](./Let's-Encrypt-and-ACME.md#test-certificates))

* `DEBUG` - Set it to `true` to enable debugging output one the container logs, which could help you troubleshoot configuration issues.

* `REUSE_ACCOUNT_KEYS` - Set it to `false` to disable the account keys and account registrations reutilization (see [ACME account keys](./Let's-Encrypt-and-ACME.md#disable-account-re-utilization)).

* `REUSE_PRIVATE_KEYS` - Set it to `true` to make `simp_le` reuse previously generated private key for each certificate instead of creating a new one on certificate renewal. Recommended if you intend to use [HPKP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public_Key_Pinning) (please not however that HPKP has been deprecated by Google's Chrome and that its use is therefore not recommended).

* `DHPARAM_BITS` - Change the size of the Diffie-Hellman key generated by the container from the default value of 2048 bits. For example `--env DHPARAM_BITS=1024` to support some older clients like Java 6 and 7.

* `NETWORK_SCOPE` â€“ The network name, that the container requesting a certificate MUST be connected to, in order to be discovered. You may find this option useful, when the host machine has multiple public IP addresses and you want to run separate nginx-proxy containers that will handle separate services with a proper networking isolation. 

If you set this environment variable, you MUST connect the nginx-proxy container to the same network. For example:

```bash
$ docker run --detach \
    --name nginx-proxy-letsencrypt \
    --volumes-from nginx-proxy \
    --volume /path/to/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:rw \
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
    --network domains_group_a
    --env "NETWORK_SCOPE=domains_group_a" \
    jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion
```

The created companion will discover only the containers, that are also connected to the `domains_group_a` network.
